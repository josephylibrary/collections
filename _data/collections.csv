She and her husband, Dennis Nyback, founded the Oregon Cartoon Institute in 2007. Anne also originated the Oregon Film History Conference in 2015. Born in 1954, she never graduated from either high school or undergraduate college, but talked her way into Columbia's MFA program and graduated with her first degree. She became obsessed with General Howard. She originally intended to write a filmscript on the Nez Perce War, but instead decided to explore developing a book or an exhibit. She never finished this project but left behind her notes, her theories about Howard's relationships with both Generals Sherman and Grant (which seem to be quite different from those of other writers), and the approach she would take. She died in 2020. Her notes roughly fit into 6 cateogries. Her notes on: 1. How she became interested in the Nez Perce and in OO Howard; 2. Her attempts to obtain funding for the project; 3. Her thougts on how she would write about the Nez Perce and the war of 1877; 4. Her thoughts and writings about OO Howard in particular; 5. Her theories and thinking about the relationships between Generals Howard, Sherman and Grant; 6.
